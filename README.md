## Welcome to the code of my site! 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

![](https://github.com/adriacanal/adriacanal.dev/workflows/ci/cd%20workflow/badge.svg)

This is the code of the site [adriacanal.dev](https://adriacanal.dev).

I use TALL Stack for the site code.

If you're not familiar with the name, it's an acronym that describes the main technologies involved in the stack:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com)

And also I use Vite instead of Laravel Mix, this is faster! ⚡️
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)

I think this combination can be called ViTALL 🌱

Thanks for visiting me!
